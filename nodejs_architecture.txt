Node.js is a cross-platform, open-source JavaScript runtime environment that can run on Windows, Linux, Unix, macOS, and more. Node.js runs on the V8 JavaScript engine, and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser. Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write command line tools and for server-side scripting.The ability to multitask that Node.js provides is extremely beneficial to web apps. Its event-driven, single-threaded design rapidly processes several simultaneous requests without clogging the RAM. Additionally, its event-loop and non-blocking I/O operations allow code to be executed at a rate that indirectly influences the applications overall performance
